# Electric Vehicle Charging Stations in India - Data Analysis

This project analyzes the distribution and patterns of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations across India using a real-world dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to derive useful insights from the data and understand the current landscape of EV infrastructure in the country.

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - EV Charging Stations in India](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saketpradhan/electric-vehicle-charging-stations-in-india)
- **Description**: Contains information on EV charging stations across India, including station name, location (city/state), address, latitude/longitude, and type of charging.

## 🔧 Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## 📊 Analysis Performed

- **States** with the most EV charging stations.
- **Top 10 Cities** with the most EV charging stations.
- **Distribution of Charging Station Types** (Slow vs Fast).
- **State-wise Count of Station Types** .
- **Distribution of Charging Station Types** in Metro and Non-Metro cities

## 🔍 Observations

- **State-wise Distribution**: Maharashtra leads in EV charging infrastructure, followed by Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.
- **City-wise Distribution**: New Delhi has the highest number of stations, followed by Bangalore and Chennai.
- **Charging Speed**: Most stations provide slow charging, reflecting cost and infrastructure limitations.
- **Metro vs Non-Metro**: Approximately 23% of all EV charging stations are located in just 9 metro cities, indicating a strong urban concentration.
- **Top Companies**: Tata Power is the most prominent company in terms of EV station deployment.

## 📌 Conclusion

The dataset reveals that India's EV infrastructure is growing but still concentrated in urban and metro regions. For a sustainable transition to electric mobility, there is a strong need to:
- Expand charging infrastructure in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities.
- Promote installation of **fast charging** stations.
- Encourage private sector and policy-level interventions for balanced EV adoption across the country.
